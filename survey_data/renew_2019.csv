2019/06/10 6:05:17 PM MDT,"Not sure, you do keep in touch so we're informed.","Being able to listen to both familiar and new works, widening my musical experience."
2019/06/10 6:07:08 PM MDT,"Have the concessions open 30 minutes before the 7:00 lectures begin. Even if the weather was awful, we were kept out on the landing and not allowed in to have a coffee or drink before the lecture.
Also, we  really object to the fact that people bring their beverages into the concert venue and sip them during the concert. ",Number one â€“ the music!   The program is always interesting and the lectures are fantastic beforehand. Also Carlâ€™s comments as the concert goes along are much appreciated. Number two - watching how much the players enjoy their jobs! The enthusiasm and the concentration and the interaction between players and between players and conductor is magical to watch.
2019/06/10 6:07:55 PM MDT,Announce before concert begins not to applaud between movements of piece.,The variety of artists and the quality of the orchestra.
2019/06/10 6:13:17 PM MDT,More seating in the lobby area,Same seats for all performances

2019/06/10 6:27:31 PM MDT,I did not enjoy the final concert which was a requiem for the sad death of the Philharmonic's  cellist.,Classical music ( and NOT the Debussey opera nor the requiem for the cellist)
2019/06/10 6:32:33 PM MDT,Please don't cut the Friday night program to accommodate the outdoor patio post-concert events.,The concerts are high quality and give us a wide range of musical experiences. I love especially hearing individual musicians perform in small ensembles such as on the most recent program. I'm sad that there isn't more publicity in the Orange County Register ...no post concert review!
2019/06/10 6:34:14 PM MDT,I  think you have everything handeled!,I enjoyed the whole experience of being a subscriber!
2019/06/10 6:35:09 PM MDT,Provide greater flexibility when crafting subscription concert sets. ,
2019/06/10 6:38:46 PM MDT,"Have the ushers control the people taking flash photos, and the people who stand for the entire concert, blocking the view of those behind them", Great seats and friendly helpful personnel 
2019/06/10 6:39:29 PM MDT,"Please include ""Listeners' Guide to the Symphony Experience"" or something entitled along that line. In other words, list ""Preferred Audience Etiquette."" You have something like that on line, and it is solely needed.By all means please include the following:   No, it is not OK to talk during the performance. No, it is NOT OK to page through your program during the performance. Yes, you seat mates on both sides and in front of you as well as behind can most probably be disturbed. For sure they might even hear your pages turn. No, just because you jump up clapping frantically and shouting at the end of a performance does NOT make you more sophisticated. Nor does that make you a classical expert. Yes, it does block the vision of at least three rows behind you. Yes, it does hurt the eardrums of those less fortunate to sit around you. I love the Symphony, but honestly I can barely tolerate the rude people who seem to gravitate around me. (POPS also, but I don't expect too much better most of the time). The yelling right behind me and whistling really does hurt my ears. Submitted by Petrina Friede","Of course, the wonderful music, the orchestra, the conductors, the Symphony staff, many patrons whom I meed during the Box Circle get togethers, the Symphony League, and the noble purpose of the Symphony.

2019/06/10 6:43:09 PM MDT,"Your development department is going to hate me, but to make the experience better there needs to be more subscriber engagement activities. Finding a way to involve Box Circle subscribers with symphony (i.e. what volunteer opportunities are available based on subscriber's interest/abilities) AND make connections with fellow attendees (i.e. a once a month coffee date or cocktail hour to talk about the upcoming performance) would be beneficial to the symphony (a more involved donor is likely to give more money) and create a richer experience for the subscriber.","As a Box Club member, having the ability to email Kay, the Box Circle and VIP Concierge, about ticket availability or purchase additional seats was paramount. I loved having one point of contact and she is absolutely delightful to work with."

2019/06/10 7:32:55 PM MDT,Somehow make concert goers understand how rude it is to take pictures and use cell phones when the artists are performing.....go to an outdoor concert!  This year the ushers were faster and better on their feet in asking rude attendees to drop the phone.  Too bad you can't do something to interfer with cell phone working in the concert hall.,"The variety of the programs, the introduction of the pieces."

2019/06/10 7:55:06 PM MDT,"We always enjoy our evenings at the Pacific Symphony. Only improvement might be expediting issuance of tickets earlier in the year, to solidify dates, but it is a minor question, really. Oh, one thing..please supply champagne flutes with champagne at intermission, even if theyâ€™re plastic!","The ability to subscribe to The POPs, (Kaufman is wonderful with his relations to movie music and local music), and still choose other programs as we want to.

2019/06/10 8:16:46 PM MDT,"Start the concert earlier in the evening. For me, when it goes past 10:00 pm, it's too late for me. I often have to leave at intermission.

2019/06/10 9:55:37 PM MDT,"This may not be the venue to discuss this but the last performance, Music Man,  was very disappointing in that we could not understand the words of the songs.
I'm very familiar with Music Man but one of our friends was not and had no idea what is was all about.  Maybe a sound problem?",
2019/06/10 9:56:12 PM MDT,"Nothing, Iâ€™ve enjoyed being a season sunscriber.","Love my seats, flexibility to exchange tickets when needed to, the musing."
2019/06/10 10:07:09 PM MDT,"For vision and hearing impaired , having the screen available is the most wonderful Improvement.  It makes all the difference in the world to my partner
who has severe hearing loss as well as macular degeneration. His enthusiasm

2019/06/10 10:11:50 PM MDT,I enjoy the multimedia experiences.

2019/06/11 12:37:17 AM MDT,The last few years we have exchanged tickets and chosen a few concerts from each of your series; Classical Escapes and Romantic Nights.

2019/06/11 3:07:25 PM MDT,We would like to know more about small group concerts the individual musicians may give. ,Being constantly surprised by the variety of wonderful music the Symphony commands. Our subscription has given us many wonderful hours of listening beyond the performances themselves. Most of the time we come away with at least one request for a new recording! 
2019/06/11 3:36:05 PM MDT,More chairs in the first floor lobby,The first half was great!!!  So was the second half!!!

2019/06/11 4:19:03 PM MDT,"I think that the Pacific Symphony should  provide an alternate to the current packages, namely providing subscribers with the choice to select performances from different packages for a season subscription. Note that the McCallum Theater in Palm Desert has done this (in fact they did away with designated packages) and the result has been increased attendance.",The same seats for every performance.
2019/06/11 4:27:46 PM MDT,,

2019/06/11 7:31:05 PM MDT,"Improve the quality of the snacks offered at intermission; perhaps more pastries, fruit & cheese plate, finger snacks, etc.  Also the coffee pre-ordered for intermission is lukewarm.  How about a thermo pitcher with cups available for pre-paid guests? Some sort of mic needs to be made available for the soloist to introduce the encore.  Unless one is seated in the front of the orchestra, all comments are lost to the rest of the audience.",The venue is wonderful.  Our seats are comfortable. The acoustics are great except when a guest soloist tries to introduce an encore without a mic.
2019/06/11 9:37:18 PM MDT,If our seats are changing it would be helpful to know where before the tickets are issued in case the change is not acceptable. This was a problem in the past.,Getting discounts to performances and knowing we have scheduled performances booked in advance.  It's too easy to forget about a concert and miss it if not pre-scheduled.
