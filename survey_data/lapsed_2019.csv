2019/06/10 6:17:54 PM MDT,"Keep up the good work!
We are saddened to not attend your programs anymore!","Well selected programs
Fabulous musicians! Carl "
2019/06/10 6:19:39 PM MDT,"Have other soloists besides pianists and violinists.  More variety in composers, early Mahler instead of late Mahler.",The creative atmosphere
2019/06/10 6:24:37 PM MDT,"Carl could improve his microphone use a little. He holds the mic too close to his mouth and it often distorts. I'm not sure if someone in the control room is ""riding"" his mic, but they should. They need to listen to the chamber sound.",Variety. Education. Meeting other subscribers.
2019/06/10 6:26:38 PM MDT,"Selecting affordable, accessible seats for my mobility challenged mother was nearly impossible. We tried to do that in a lower priced tier and ended up with limited visibility seats. When I renewed our subscription online, I chose the movable seats on the Promenade Circle but when our tickets arrived those weren't our assigned seats. We were frustrated and disappointed. That seems like an unkind way to treat an 80 year old woman with poor balance and limited strength who can only manage a few steps at a time and finds shuffling along a row of seats over a steep drop to the next row very difficult and scary.  When my mother called she was told there was nothing to be done about it except upgrade. We went ahead and paid to upgrade so we could have accessible seats with better visibility. I'm really disappointed in how hard it is to get decent seats in a more affordable price range for someone with limited mobility.","I loved the shows where the Symphony played first and then the guest artist came out after intermission. I love the surprise of not knowing what is going to be selected, the words of introduction by the conductor and then enjoying music with which I may or may not be familiar. I also really enjoyed some of the less familiar performers, like Seth McFarland (last season, I know)."
2019/06/10 6:36:31 PM MDT,Too many repeat artists and offerings. Need more variety,Love the Pacific Symphony Pops Series
2019/06/10 6:43:40 PM MDT,None. Have loved every minute!,6 dates planned with one phone call; world class musicians and performances; leadership of Richard Kaufmann
2019/06/10 6:48:09 PM MDT,"The first couple of years were spectacular,  but I have grown tired of geezer concerts where the performer's voices are but hollow remembrances of their voices and one or two good records 50 years ago.  If I wanted raspy hollow voices, I would buy a dog and have him howl at the moon.  Also, padding of your schedule with providing the soundtrack to old movies, whether they were any good to begin with, is annoying.  A novelty when not overdone, but you guys overdid it years ago.","When you have great acts, like you did a couple of times in the past year as with Leslie Odam and the recent Music Man (which wasn't the My Fair Lady indicated on the tickets)."

2019/06/10 8:07:21 PM MDT,"No improvements necessary.  We had to move back to Indiana, to care for parents in their 90's, in Indianapolis.  Our hope is to move back home to Orange County one day, and when we do, we will be Subscribers once again!!  Please keep us on your mailing list, if possible, as if there is a trip back to see friends while we are still living here, it would be great to time it with a PSO concert.  
(susan@intoknow.com - email)  ","For the concerts we attended prior to our move, we simply loved the orchestra.  As a former employee of Opera Pacific, I feel keeping the Arts alive in Orange County is important, and PSO shows great efforts to do so.  Thank you!!  "

2019/06/11 11:29:15 AM MDT,"We were season subscribers for nearly 10 years.  We had the same seats until this past year.  When we arrived for the first symphony, six seats in front of us had been removed and arm chairs had replaced them .  They were higher than the regular seats.  We couldn't see - although my husband is 6'4""!!  We discussed this with the usher and she offered to move us to available seats explaining that it was ""temporary"".  It was not - and resulted in our seats being moved to wherever there was an available seats for each symphony for the remainder of the season.  The programming seemed repetitive and mediocre.  We continued with the Pacific Chorale series for next year but will replace the Pacific Symphony tickets with single tickets to other series.","For many years we looked forward to the variety of music we experienced, including hearing internationally famous stars and composers."

2019/06/11 5:44:00 PM MDT,Everything was always wonderful,"My husband and I always enjoyed  The Pops with Richard Kaufmann for many many years at Segerstrom Center and later after the Concert Hall was opened.
I had to give my seats up due to health reasons .  After my husband passed away six years ago , I still was able to bring family or friends with me but now I am not able to get around very well.   I will so miss coming as enjoyed every single concert all these many years, the symphony  music is absolutely beautiful."
2019/06/11 6:05:07 PM MDT,"None.  I love going to Pacific Symphony concerts.  I was only able to go to 3 or 4 for the entire season.  Otherwise I banked or gave away tickets, and several of those went unused.  Hoping that things will quiet down enough to make more concerts, and then will renew.  Thank you for everything.  ","Everything.  The quality of the symphony.  The diversity and quality of the programs.  The themes; especially those that had an uplifting and spiritual content.  The acoustics.  The nuances.  Carl.  The introductory lessons at 7:00 pm for the evening's program, and interviews with guest artists.  Like I said - everything.  "
